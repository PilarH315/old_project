    <h1>Pilar Hernandez</h1>
    <p>I finally got to learn coding on Codecademy! After finding out about their Pro-membership donation program for workers affected by all the lockdowns due to COVID-19, I applied for one and got it for 3 months. Yay!</p>
    <h3>My goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn to code, of course</li>
        <li>Work on my own web pages and possibly apps</li>
        <li>Get a job in UI/UX</li>
        <li>Make clothes with strings of LEDs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm also a cosplayer and I have my own store in
        <a href="https://queenpilicosplay.threadless.com/" class="link">Threadless.</a></p>
    <p id="postscript">This will be my online resume at some point. I have yet to add navigation and contact info, but not today.</p>
